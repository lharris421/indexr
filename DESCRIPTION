Description: Helps with the thoughtful saving, reading, and management of result
  files (using 'rds' files). The core functions take a list of parameters that are
  used to generate a unique hash to save results under. Then, the same
  parameter list can be used to read those results back in. This
  is helpful to avoid clunky file naming when running a large number of
  simulations. Additionally, helper functions are available for compiling a flat
  file of parameters of saved results, monitoring result usage, and cleaning up
  unwanted or unused results. For more information, visit the 'indexr' homepage
